# Coding Challenge
This repository contains a list of coding challenges used in the hiring process at Bankdata. As an applicant you can choose to implement one of the challenges or alternatively share some of your existing code.

## Existing Code
Existing code should follow the guidelines:

- The code should be available through a public repository
- Include a README describing the purpose of the code
- The code should be exclusively or primarily written by you
  - If this is not the case, the README should explain which parts of the code you are responsible for

## Coding Challenges
### Requirements
The solution should reflect what you consider production-ready code, which means the code probably contains at least the following:

- **Architecture**: the solution ideally has a coherent architecture using best practices of software engineering
- **Tests**: we do not expect complete test coverage, but just some examples of tests that reflect your approach to testing
- **Documentation**: the README should explain in brief and clear terms which problem the code is trying to solve and how the solution solves it

We are more interested in your approach to solving a problem than the solution itself, so solve these challenges using any language and tech-stack you are comfortable in. Ideally, you are able to describe why a given technology was chosen.

There is no time limit for the challenges, but we do not expect you to spend more than three to four hours on a challenge. Don't be discouraged if you are unable to complete all the requirements. The challenge is only used to provide a basis for discussion at the following interview.

### Evaluation
The solution will be reviewed by an engineer and discussed at the following interview.
